# These files include some resources intended for running a Ceph *cluster*
# in the same namespace as the *operator*,
# but they don't run any pods for this purpose,
# so we ignore this and create the cluster in `cephalopod`,
# using the `common-second-cluster.yaml` manifest from the examples as described here:
# <https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Storage-Configuration/Advanced/ceph-configuration/#deploying-a-second-cluster>
#
# See /kubernasty/foundation/cephalopod/common-cephalopod.yaml for that.
