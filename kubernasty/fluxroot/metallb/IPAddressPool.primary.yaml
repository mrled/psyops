# IP address is the primary address for most HTTP/HTTPS services in the cluster.
# DNS name is kubernasty-primary... and many other services can be CNAME records to that,
# and the ingress controller will route to the right service via the Host header or SNI.
# This is NOT the address for a high availability control plane,
# which is handled by the keepalived built in to k0s itself
# and not by MetalLB at all.
