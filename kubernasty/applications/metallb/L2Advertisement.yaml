# In order for MetalLB to work on Layer 2,
# it needs only some spare IP addresses that will not be used for other hosts,
# and no special switch configs for BGP or whatever.
#
# It does require an L2Advertisement resource to be created in the metallb-system namespace.
# The resource created here does not have an IPAddressPool selector,
# which means it will advertise all available pools.
