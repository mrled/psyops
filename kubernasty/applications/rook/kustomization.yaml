  # The un-modified rook-ceph manifests from the project

  # As a convention, all kubernasty changes are tagged with a comment `kubernasty:customized`,
  # so that we can easily identify them.
  # UPDATE: Now we use patches instead, so we don't need to customize the original files at all.
  #
  # These files include some resources intended for running a Ceph *cluster*
  # in the same namespace as the *operator*,
  # but they don't run any pods for this purpose,
  # so we ignore this and create the cluster in `cephalopod`,
  # using the `common-second-cluster.yaml` manifest from the examples as described here:
  # <https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Storage-Configuration/Advanced/ceph-configuration/#deploying-a-second-cluster>
  #
  # See /kubernasty/foundation/cephalopod/common-cephalopod.yaml for that.
