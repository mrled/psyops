          # The path attribute is using GJSON Path Syntax
          # https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md#multipaths
          #
          # The value attribute should be a single value (?) using Go regexp syntax

          #
          # The Gitea webhook mostly is GitHub compatible.
          # Both send a rather large JSON payload, including a list of commits
          # and a list of files modified/added/removed in each.
          # So our GJSON path value will parse a payload like this one (heavily truncated):

          #     ]
          #   }
          # }
          # into a JSON list of all the files modified/added/removed, like this:
          # ["pipelines/macrofactor/README.md"]
          #
          # The Go regexp then acts on THAT RESULT.
          #
          # With that in mind, we can write regexps that assume a double-quote
          # marks the beginning and end of a filename.
          # I do not bother trying to be robust enough to handle filenames with double quotes in them,
          # if your repo has that GFYS.
