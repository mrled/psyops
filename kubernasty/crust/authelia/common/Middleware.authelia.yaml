    # The easiest way to test these is to deploy a whoami container,
    # which prints all the headers it receives for any request.
    authResponseHeaders:

      # # X-Forwarded-* is the most standard way to convey the user, groups, email, and (full) name.
      # # However, they don't seem to actually be forwarded. ??
      # - X-Forwarded-User
      # - X-Forwarded-Groups
      # - X-Forwarded-Email
      # - X-Forwarded-Name

      # Remote-* headers convey the same information, and are not unusual but less standard.
      # However they seem to actually be forwarded.
      - Remote-User
      - Remote-Groups
      - Remote-Email
      - Remote-Name

      # The proxy IP address is sent in this header to the backend services
      # Backends must be configured to trust the IP address sent in this header
      # The value is the IP address of the proxy server --
      # I think this means the LoadBalancer IP address
      - X-Forwarded-For

      # Forwards the JWT token issued by Authelia
      # Required for kubernetes-dashboard at least
      - Authorization
