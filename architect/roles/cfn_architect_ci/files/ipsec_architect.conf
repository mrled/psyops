    # Change from Algo-generated version:
    # start the tunnel when trying to route packets to 'rightsubnet'
    # We add a cron job to ping a host on the tunnel,
    # and this way we ensure the tunnel is always up
    # Better than auto=start, because if the tunnel goes down
    # (like if the VPN server reboots) auto=start will not restart it,
    # but auto=route will try again the next time packets are routed to it.
