<h1>Welcome to the unsafe onion proxy!</h1>
<p>This domain can be used to transparently visit Tor sites. However, it does NOT rewrite URLs in HTML, meaning that any full URL with http://whatever.onion... will not work. <em>It is not safe to visit these in a browser</em> unless the browser's user is ok with their identity being leaked to Tor sites (and their Tor activity leaked to malicious sites). It's intended for programmatic use like for zlib.</p>
